# Some tricks I have used
## To prevent bot always winning in TicTacToe
There is use of probability in every move suchh that bot sometime make mistakes and there is randomness in the game.
- If bot wins in next move, then only 90% of the time the bot plays the winning move,
- If user is going to win on next move, bot blocks it 75% of the time,
- Bot tries to go with center piece only 20% of the time,
- Similarly, corner pieces are favored 30% of the time.

This also prevents high draws and let user win occasionally.

# Tools Used
1. React JS
2. For sliders I used `react-siders` by Airbnb.
